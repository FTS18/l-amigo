Note: Icon placeholder files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) need to be created.
You can:
1. Use an online SVG to PNG converter to convert public/icon.svg to the required sizes
2. Or use any design tool to create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files

For now, the extension will work but may show a broken icon in Chrome until these files are added.
